                            Disk Partitions in Linux

A disk partition must be formatted and mounted before use. The formatting process can also be done for several other reasons, such as changing the file system, fixing errors, or deleting all data.

================================================
lsblk
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
n 
p
1
w
==================================================
====
Checking the Partitions
lsblk
The terminal prints out a list of all block devices as well as information about them:

    NAME – Device names
    MAJ:MIN – Major or minor device numbers
    RM – Whether the device is removable (1 if yes, 0 if no)
    SIZE – The size of the device
    RO – Whether the device is read-only
    TYPE – The type of the device
    MOUNTPOINT – Device’s mount point
====
To display a list containing file system information, add the -f option:
lsblk -f

                     Formatting Disk Partition in Linux
There are three ways to format disk partitions using the mkfs command, depending on the file system type:
            ext4
    	    FAT32
    	    NTFS
=====
                     Formatting Disk Partition with ext4 File System
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
==========
Formatting Disk Partition with FAT32 File System
sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1
==========
Formatting Disk Partition with NTFS File System
sudo mkfs -t ntfs /dev/sdb1
==========
Next, verify the file system change using:
lsblk -f
============
Mounting the Disk Partition in Linux
sudo mkdir -p [mountpoint]
sudo mount -t auto /dev/sdb1 [mountpoint]
==================
Next, verify the file system change using:
lsblk -f
======================
To mount auto
vi /etc/fstab
